# Element, Function, Group

A methodology for describing documents.

## What is the Element?

Any object made by human can be divided into _Elements,_ and any Element can carry _Functions._

## What is the Function?

The term _Function_ in E-F-G is used more widely than usual. By default it responds to the question 'What does it mean?' or 'What is the purpose of this?'.
